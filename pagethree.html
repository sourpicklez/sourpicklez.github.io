<h1>Mexican Hot Spicy Pickles</h1>

In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Bring to a light boil or until all of the salt is dissolved.

Chop up the red onion (you can peel and discard the outer skin).  I cut it into quarters and then slice lengthwise.

Give the slices a quick toss and then stuff them in a pint-sized glass jar.  Add the vinegar mixture along with 1 garlic clove chopped in half and some freshly ground pepper (or whole peppercorns).

Let cool on counter.  Then cover and store in the refrigerator.

The pickled onions will have most of their flavor after a few hours of resting in the brine.
